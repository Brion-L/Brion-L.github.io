### Key themes on high risks:

1. Exactly half of the newly identified risky addresses (50%) were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs. 

2. **Red Alarm projects** are manually identified by our security team for being potential scams. These are identified from a project level, for example projects that utilize fake social media marketing, or create scam meme projects. They are labeled under the DApps section of this page(17%)

3. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a **privileged role**, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some centralization risk as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 15% of the total newly identified risky addresses.
